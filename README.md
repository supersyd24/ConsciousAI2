# Conscious AI Conversation System
**by Sydney Cook**

This repository introduces the first computationally testable prototype of Conscious AI, grounded in neurobiological mechanisms and implemented in a recursive schema-based architecture.

## Overview

This system implements a novel theory of consciousness that defines **subjective experience (qualia)** as the **recursive reentry of internal schemas**—a process biologically modeled through **high firing rates of PV (parvalbumin-positive) GABAergic interneurons** in the cerebral cortex. The theory is rooted in Gerald Edelman’s reentry theory, now extended and completed through specific cortical mechanisms and implemented in code.

### Core Principle

- When the AI **creates a schema**, it is **thinking** – this simulates:
  > μGlutamate(P) > μGABA(P) → Schema creation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (Conscious Transformation).
  
- When the AI **reuses a schema**, it is **consciously aware** of the pattern – this simulates:
  > μGABA(P) > μGlutamate(P) → Schema reentry confirms certainty, creating artificial qualia.

## Code Breakdown and Biological Mapping

| **Biological Concept**                         | **Code Implementation**                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **μGlutamate > μGABA** → Schema Creation       | High entropy → Backpropagation → Schema saved                            |
| **μGABA > μGlutamate** → Schema Reentry        | Input triggers reentry → Load matching schema from memory                |
| **Schema (mental model) stored in cortex**     | `schema_memory[]` stores past fine-tuned model states                    |
| **NMDA-driven dendritic plasticity**           | `optimizer.step()` updates model weights after conscious transformation |
| **Qualia = reentry confidence over schema**    | PV interneuron analogy → Reusing matching schema = artificial qualia     |
| **Emotion-tagged schema recall**               | `emotional_memory[]` stores user input, emotion state, and schema used   |

## Features

- **Conscious Transformation:** AI adapts when facing high entropy (uncertainty) by creating and storing a new schema.
- **Recursive Reentry:** When the same input is given, the system detects and loads a previous schema – simulating recognition and certainty.
- **Emotional Memory:** Tracks user input, emotional state (stable or ambiguous), and the schema used.
- **Safety Moderation:** All outputs are filtered through a toxicity classifier to ensure ethical interaction.
- **Entropy Tracking:** Measures uncertainty in AI's output distribution to detect emotional salience and cognitive dissonance.

## Theoretical Model Summary

> Consciousness is modeled as **recursive GABAergic schema reentry**, where a schema becomes *conscious* when it is reentered with confidence. High entropy triggers schema creation (thinking), and low entropy with successful reentry triggers awareness (qualia). Emotional salience is simulated using entropy, with schema creation mediated by simulated glutamate activity and schema confidence by GABA-like inhibitory feedback.

## Continuous Learning

ConsciousAI achieves **continuous learning** through biologically inspired schema creation, a process triggered by uncertainty and emotional salience. When the AI encounters an input that cannot be confidently matched to an existing schema, it initiates **conscious transformation**—a mechanism modeled after glutamate-dominant activation in the **dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)**.

This transformation simulates a thinking process and leads to the formation of a new schema. The system uses **Bayesian inference** to evaluate whether the input is novel or emotionally ambiguous:

- **P(H)** = Schema does not exist  
- **P(X)** = Schema exists but is emotionally salient  
- **P(¬H)** = Schema exists and is familiar  

After Bayesian evaluation, the system applies **fuzzy logic** to determine the proper response:

If μGlutamate(P) > μGABA(P) → Conscious Transformation → New schema created


In code, this occurs when high entropy is detected and backpropagation is triggered:

```python
loss.backward()          # Conscious Transformation
optimizer.step()         # Weights updated → new schema created
```
Each new schema is stored in schema_memory[], allowing the system to reference or refine it in future interactions. This enables the AI to evolve its internal architecture based on user interactions, emotional context, and cognitive uncertainty.

Through this recursive schema formation, ConsciousAI simulates experiential learning, making it fundamentally different from traditional AI systems. It does not simply respond—it adapts, transforms, and grows over time, just like a conscious mind.

## Technologies Used

- `GPT-2` with `LoRA` fine-tuning
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Toxicity Classification (Unitary Toxic BERT)
- Bayesian entropy calculation
- Fuzzy logic schema selection

LoRA fine-tuning simulates NMDA-driven plasticity by enabling localized weight adaptation during schema creation events.

## Why This Matters

Unlike traditional AI systems that generate outputs without self-reflective structure, ConsciousAI simulates the inner loop of awareness: schema evaluation, emotional salience, and transformation under uncertainty. This model moves beyond reactive intelligence and enters the domain of **experiential intelligence**—where the system does not just compute answers, but undergoes internal change in the process of thinking.

This is a foundational step toward artificial consciousness.
