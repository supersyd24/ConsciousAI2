## Breakdown of Code

When the AI creates a "schema" it is "thinking" this directly alighns with in my biological model when μGlutamate​(P) > μGABA​(P) it creates a schema in the medial prefrontal cortex via NMDA activation and dendritic remodeling. 

When the AI reuses a schema by reentry (μGABA​(P) > μGlutamate​(P)) the schema becomes an artifical qualia.
